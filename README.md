# eInk Blockclock
[[/assets/ep_blockclock.png|Ooooh shiny!]]

### Purpose
Since I don't have my a Blockclock or Blockclock Mini (https://blockclockmini.com/), I wanted to make my own! Impress all your friends by fitting the price of bitcoin into a single e-ink display (one digit of the Blockclock Mini).

### Gear
 - Raspberry Pi Zero W
 - Waveshare e-ink 2.13 v2 Display
 - Power source

### Console
[[/assets/ep_blockclock_console.png|Console output]]

### Notes
This doesn't have have the level of functionality (OpenDime), love, or error handling that the Blockclocks do. They are really nice pieces of hardware and I do not wish to take anything away from them.
