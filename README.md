# eInk Blockclock
[[https://github.com/ronaldstoner/epaper_blockclock/blob/main/assets/ep_blockclock.png?raw=true|Ooooh shiny!]]

### Purpose
Since I don't have my a Blockclock or Blockclock Mini (https://blockclockmini.com/), I wanted to make my own! Impress all your friends by fitting the price of bitcoin into a single e-ink display (one digit of the Blockclock Mini).

### Gear
 - Raspberry Pi Zero W
 - Waveshare e-ink 2.13 v2 Display
 - Power source

### Console

### Notes
This doesn't have have the level of functionality (OpenDime), love, or error handling that the Blockclocks do. They are really nice pieces of hardware and I do not wish to take anything away from them.
